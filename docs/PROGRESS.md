- Created: `PROGRESS.md`

## Current Todo Items

### ðŸ“‹ Immediate Tasks (None)
No urgent development tasks currently. Project has reached production-ready status.

### ðŸ“‹ Short-term Tasks (1-2 weeks)
No planned short-term tasks currently. Project functionality is complete.

### ðŸ“‹ Medium-term Tasks (1-2 months)
Refer to future requirements in `REQUIREMENTS.md`:
- [ ] Monitoring metrics export (Prometheus)
- [ ] Distributed tracing support
- [ ] Configuration hot reload

### ðŸ“‹ Long-term Tasks (3+ months)
- [ ] Performance optimization (memory pools, lock-free concurrency)
- [ ] Support for more encoding formats
- [ ] Support for custom time precision

## Technical Decision Records

### TD1. ID Bit Allocation Design
**Date**: Early 2025
**Decision**: Use 10+41+2+10 bit allocation (type+timestamp+node+sequence)
**Reasons**:
- Type bits expanded to 10 bits supporting 1024 ID types
- Timestamp 41 bits supports approximately 69 years of use
- Node 2 bits limits to 4 instances maximum, suitable for small-scale distributed needs
- Sequence 10 bits supports 1024 IDs per millisecond

### TD2. Clock Resilience Strategy
**Date**: Early 2025
**Decision**: Implement conservative clock rollback handling
**Reasons**:
- Use last time instead of waiting when clock rolls back
- Reduce warning log frequency to avoid log flooding
- Add early attempt mechanism to optimize fixed timestamp scenarios

### TD3. HTTP Service Architecture
**Date**: Early 2025
**Decision**: Independent HTTP service rather than library-only approach
**Reasons**:
- Support multi-language client integration
- Simplify usage in microservice architectures
- Provide standardized RESTful API

### TD4. Containerization Deployment Strategy
**Date**: Early 2025
**Decision**: Multi-stage Docker build + Nginx load balancing
**Reasons**:
- Multi-stage build reduces image size
- Nginx provides high-performance load balancing
- Support horizontal scaling and high availability

### TD5. Documentation Language Policy
**Date**: 2025-01-13
**Decision**: Standardize all project files to use English exclusively
**Reasons**:
- Improve accessibility for international contributors
- Maintain consistency across all project documentation
- Follow open source best practices for global collaboration
- Ensure compatibility with automated tools and CI/CD systems

## Performance Benchmarks

### Latest Performance Data
- **Library generation performance**: ~976 ns/op (single-threaded)
- **Concurrent generation capability**: >1M IDs/second
- **HTTP service response**: <1ms
- **Base58 encoding**: ~11 ns/op
- **Base64 encoding**: ~31 ns/op

### Test Coverage
- **Core library coverage**: >95%
- **Number of test cases**: 100+
- **Benchmark tests**: Complete coverage of all core functionality

## Deployment Status

### Development Environment
- âœ… Local development environment fully configured
- âœ… Test suite running normally
- âœ… Make commands working properly

### Production Environment Preparation
- âœ… Docker image building normally
- âœ… Multi-instance deployment configuration complete
- âœ… Health check mechanism ready
- âœ… Load balancing configuration complete

## Issues and Risk Records

### Resolved Issues
1. **Clock rollback handling** - Resolved through conservative strategy and warning mechanism
2. **Sequence exhaustion** - Resolved through wait mechanism and early attempt optimization
3. **Concurrent safety** - Resolved through mutex locks and race condition testing verification

### Current Risks
No major risks. Project has been thoroughly tested and validated.

### Potential Risks
1. **Node count limitation** - Only supports 4 nodes, may need expansion in future
2. **Timestamp overflow** - Will need epoch redesign after approximately 69 years
3. **Performance bottleneck** - May need lock-free optimization in high concurrency scenarios

## Documentation Status

### Completed Documentation
- âœ… `README.md` - Main project documentation
- âœ… `CLAUDE.md` - AI development guide
- âœ… `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Project structure document
- âœ… `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Requirements document
- âœ… `docs/PROGRESS.md` - Progress tracking document
- âœ… `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- âœ… `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- âœ… Service documentation (`examples/service/README.md`)

### Documentation Maintenance Status
All core documentation is up-to-date, standardized in English, and synchronized with code implementation.

## Next Session Recovery Guide

**Session recovery checklist**:
1. Review `docs/PROGRESS.md` to confirm last status
2. Check for new user requirements or changes
3. Evaluate if `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` needs updates
4. Confirm current development priorities

**Current recommended actions**:
- Project has reached production-ready status with complete English documentation
- Can focus on user feedback and optimization requirements
- Can begin planning monitoring and operational enhancement features
